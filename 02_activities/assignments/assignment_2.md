# Data Visualization

## Assignment 2: Good and Bad Data Visualization

### Requirements:

- Data visualizations are important tools for communication and convincing; we need to be able to evaluate the ways that data are presented in visual form to be critical consumers of information 
- To test your evaluation skills, locate two public data visualizations online, one good and one bad  
    - You can find data visualizations at https://public.tableau.com/app/discover or https://datavizproject.com/, or anywhere else you like! 
- For each visualization (good and bad):  
    - Explain (with reference to material covered up to date, along with readings and other scholarly sources, as needed) why you classified that visualization the way you did.
      ```
      Your answer...

      I will evaluate one bad and one good example of a data visualization based the three important qualities: 
      *Aesthetic: Is the visualization pleasing to look at?  
      *Substantive: Does the visualization accurately and honestly present data? (It doesn't have to be neutral but it should be factual)
      *Perceptual: Can we understand what message the maker of the visualization is attempting to convey? 
      
      I will also try to figure out its intended purpose, intended audience and intended medium. 
      
      Additionally, I will also comment on the effectiveness of the visualization. 
      
      Finally, I will consider factors such as colour, size, use of images to evaluate whether it is a good data visualization. 
      
      An example of a bad visualization: https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/hideaki.y/viz/B2VB2025Week13/dashboard 
      The reason I think this is a bad example is the following: 
      
      *Aesthetic: The visualization is not good in terms of aesthetic because the colouring does not make sense: It does not go from darker to lighter or it doesn't use any coloring schedule to emphasize/show the scale of each sports club. Also, some bubbles have some intersection with the next one and some of them do not have that which does not make any sense in terms of the content.
      
      *Substantive: The viz shows the most expensive sports teams around the world in a clear and simple way, this is fine. However, it has some deficiencies. First of all, it does not specify the definition of "price". Is it the market value of the sports club or book value or anything else? We do not know this information. I can see the source as "Sherwood Media" but a direct link and a brief explanation in the bottom part of the viz would be better to see how this calculation is made. Also, when I click on the "Sports" as a filter, I would expect to select or see the top 10 expensive clubs based on different kinds of sports (basketball, American football etc). However, it does not provide any further information based on different kinds of sports. There is the same issue with the "Country" filter. 

      *Perceptual: We can understand the message of the creator which shows a factual information on the most expensive sports teams around the world in a simple and clear way. However, the deficiencies mentioned above impact the message negatively. The information provided in the viz is limited without any sports branch or country selection. 

      The viz's intended purpose is to show the most expensive sports teams around the world in a clear and simple way.
      
      The intended audience is the people who are interested in sports. However, the audience would like to see more information with sports branch and country filters. Also, more information could be added to make it more attractive (explained in the next question). 
      
      Intended medium is obviously web. 

      As I said before, the viz could be more effective with the points stated in the aesthetic aspect. Also, with more information and filters mentioned above, it could convey its message more effectively. 

      An example of a good visualization: https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/p.padham/viz/SuperstoreDashboard_16709573699130/SuperstoreDashboard 

      *Aesthetic: The viz is great in terms of aesthetic. It gives lots of information without confusing the audience with a good design and colors, and it is not eye-straining at all which is really important for financial and commercial dashboards that aims top executives. 

      *Substantive: The viz provides sales, profit and orders information by state, by segment, by top 10 manufacturers, by category and sub-category and by top 10 customers. The information is rich and presented very clearly and accurately. Most probably, the dashboard is created for managers/top executives and the viz is perfect for this audience. It shows the summary of sales, orders and profit data and you can select each of them and the graph changes interactively. 
      It also shows the previous period's numbers with a line in each graph and the percentage change from previous period at the top of each component which are great to compare the performance and the trend. 
      Also, when you select a detail for each graph or map (state, segment, category, manufacturer etc.), the other graphs will interactively change which is beneficial and important to see the details for each selection. 
      In addition, when you go on a component, it shows the name and the sales/profit/order info of the relevant component which is informative. 
      Also, at the top, you can see the summary totals and its change from previous period which is useful to see the performance and trend in total numbers. 
      Besides, it shows order details in another page which is useful to see details of each order with customer name, location, sales amount, quantity etc. Also, it has filters for different parameters which provides flexibility in the viz. 
      Hence, all information given in this clear viz would improve data-driven strategic decision making at the top maangement level which is crucial for organizations. 
      
      *Perceptual: We can understand the message of the creator which provides a factual information on the performance of the company. The sales, profit and orders numbers are shown in different breakdowns with understandable graphs which lead to a great presentation to the intended audience.
      
     The viz's intended purpose is to show the financial and commercial information of the company with a factual dashboard. 

     The intended audience is managers and top executives. The viz is designed to be understood by both technical and non-technical stakeholders which is crucial for dashboards aimed at top executives. 

     The intended medium is web Tableau platform for the organization.  

     The viz is perfectly effective to present financial and commercial information of the company in a clear and aesthetic way with rich factual information. I think this is a great example of data visualization that could be used within organizations. 

     Besides, in terms of cognitive load (the amount of work required to take in new information for the audience), we know that extraneous cognitive load is within our control. This viz is also successful in this sense by using familiar chart types, giving absolute values (accurate) and having concise composition.

     Finally, according to Kennedy et al. (2016)'s four conventions of data visualization (two-dimensional image, clean layouts, geometric shapes and lines, and inclusion of data sources at the bottom of the image), this viz is successful in the perceived objectivity and factual basis of a visualization. 


      ```
    - How could this data visualization have been improved?  
      ```
      Your answer...
      The bad example of viz can be improved in terms of aesthetic with a colouring palette from darker to lighter to show the scale of each sports club. The buble size is already showing the scale of each team and it could be supported by a relevant colouring. For ex: Los Angeles Lakers as the 1st would be the darkest purple and Carolina Panthers as the 10th would be the lightest purple. Besides, the title could be smaller to give more space to the bubbles and more information (mentioned below) for each sports team. 

      In terms of substantive aspect, it can be improved by adding the link of the source with a brief explanation of the calculation of the price. Besides, top 10 most expensive teams based on different kinds of sports could be shown when we click on "Sports" and select a specific sports branch in the viz. So, let's say, if I select basketball, I should see top 10 most expensive basketball clubs around the world. Same filter should be added for country. When I select a country, the viz should show top 10 most expensive clubs for the selected country. It would improve the content of the viz and make it more attractive with more information. 

      In terms of perceptual aspect, I think when the problems in the substantive aspect have been improved, then the message would be better conveyed to the audience. 

      To attract the audience better, a few more details could be added to the viz with sports branch and country filters as mentioned above. Also, the breakdown of the revenue of each club could be added with interactive choices to give more information to the audience who are interested. For ex: When I click on Los Angeles Lakers, I would like to see more information of the breakdown of its price/revenue. Also, some interesting information could be added for each team (such as most expensive player, most scoring player etc.) to make it more attractive. 

      For the good example of viz, the colouring would be different to make it more relevant. The top component in each graph is shown with blue and the rest is in gray. I do not find this colouring very informative. I think they should use colouring palette as darkest blue for the top component and gets lighter for the second, third etc. To illustrate, for sales numbers, top category is technology. So, dark blue bar for technology would be better. Then, blue for office supplies as it is the second category in terms of sales. And light blue for furniture as it is the third category in terms of sales. This coloring schedule would also emphasize the ranking of each component. It would improve the viz in terms of aesthetic aspect and would attract the intended audience more. 

      Also, the viz shows the date but it doesn't allow to select different date periods, it only allows the year selection. I would suggest to add a filter for different date periods because it is important for executives to see and compare different periods (such as months, weeks). It would improve the viz in terms of substantive aspect. 

      Finally, they could add the percentage to each graph which is important to see the percentage of the relevant component to evaluate its share in total numbers. To illustrate, they could add percentage of each segment - Consumer 45%, Corporate 33% and Home Office 22%. Same could be applied to each graph (state, manufacturers, category, etc.). 

      
      ```
- Word count should not exceed (as a maximum) 500 words for each visualization (i.e. 
300 words for your good example and 500 for your bad example)
